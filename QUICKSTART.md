# Quick Start Guide - OpenFOAM Language Support

Get up and running with the OpenFOAM VS Code extension in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code 1.75.0 or higher
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenFOAM installation (for keyword extraction)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Build the Extension

```bash
cd /Users/arefmoalemi/Downloads/OpenFOAM-13-master/openfoam-vscode-extension

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Extract keywords from OpenFOAM source (already done!)
# npm run extract-keywords
# OR specify custom path:
# node out/extractor/extractKeywords.js /path/to/your/OpenFOAM-source
```

âœ… **Good news!** Keyword extraction has already been completed with **2990 keywords** extracted from your OpenFOAM-13 source.

### 2. Install in VS Code

Choose one of these methods:

#### Method A: Extension Development Host (Recommended for testing)

1. Open the extension folder in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code /Users/arefmoalemi/Downloads/OpenFOAM-13-master/openfoam-vscode-extension
   ```

2. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host

3. In the new window, open an OpenFOAM file from the examples:
   ```bash
   # In the Extension Development Host window
   File â†’ Open File â†’ examples/controlDict
   ```

#### Method B: Install as Extension

1. Copy to extensions directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r /Users/arefmoalemi/Downloads/OpenFOAM-13-master/openfoam-vscode-extension \
         ~/.vscode/extensions/openfoam-language-support-0.1.0
   ```

2. Restart VS Code

3. Open any OpenFOAM file

#### Method C: Package and Install VSIX

```bash
# Install packaging tool
npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Package the extension
cd /Users/arefmoalemi/Downloads/OpenFOAM-13-master/openfoam-vscode-extension
vsce package

# This creates: openfoam-language-support-0.1.0.vsix
# Install via: Extensions â†’ ... â†’ Install from VSIX
```

## Test the Extension

### 1. Open Example Files

The `examples/` directory contains sample OpenFOAM files:

- **controlDict** - Time and simulation control
- **fvSchemes** - Discretization schemes
- **fvSolution** - Linear solver settings
- **U** - Velocity field with boundary conditions

### 2. Test Syntax Highlighting

Open any example file. You should see:
- ðŸŸ¦ Blue keywords (e.g., `application`, `startTime`, `solver`)
- ðŸŸ© Green strings and comments
- ðŸŸ¨ Yellow numbers
- ðŸŸª Purple types (e.g., `fixedValue`, `zeroGradient`)

### 3. Test Hover

Hover over keywords to see documentation:
- Hover over `deltaT` â†’ Shows "Time step size (seconds)"
- Hover over `solver` â†’ Shows solver types and parameters
- Hover over `fixedValue` â†’ Shows boundary condition details

### 4. Test Auto-Completion

Start typing in a dictionary:
1. Type `del` â†’ See `deltaT` suggestion
2. Press `Enter` â†’ Snippet inserts `deltaT        ${1:value};`
3. Type `sol` â†’ See `solver` and related keywords
4. Select `solver` â†’ Inserts solver block template

### 5. Test Command

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Win/Linux)
2. Type "OpenFOAM: Refresh"
3. Select "OpenFOAM: Refresh Keyword Database"
4. Enter OpenFOAM path when prompted (or cancel)

## Verify Installation

Check the Output panel:
1. View â†’ Output
2. Select "OpenFOAM Language Server" from dropdown
3. Should see: "OpenFOAM Language Server ready with 2990 keywords"

## Using with Your OpenFOAM Cases

Once installed, the extension automatically activates for:

### By File Extension
- `*.foam`
- `*.dict`

### By Filename
- `controlDict`
- `fvSchemes`
- `fvSolution`
- `blockMeshDict`
- `snappyHexMeshDict`
- `decomposeParDict`
- `*Properties`
- `*Dict`

Just open any of these files in VS Code and start editing!

## Common Tasks

### Update Keyword Database

If you update OpenFOAM or want to extract from a different version:

```bash
cd /Users/arefmoalemi/Downloads/OpenFOAM-13-master/openfoam-vscode-extension
node out/extractor/extractKeywords.js /path/to/new/OpenFOAM
cp out/data/openfoam-keywords.json data/openfoam-keywords.json

# Then reload VS Code
```

### Watch Mode for Development

```bash
cd /Users/arefmoalemi/Downloads/OpenFOAM-13-master/openfoam-vscode-extension
npm run watch

# In another terminal or press F5 in VS Code
```

### Debug the Extension

1. Open extension folder in VS Code
2. Set breakpoints in TypeScript files
3. Press `F5` to launch debugger
4. Extension runs in new window with debugger attached

### Debug the Language Server

1. Uncomment `--inspect` in server options (src/extension.ts line 56)
2. Launch extension with `F5`
3. Open Chrome/Edge: `chrome://inspect`
4. Click "inspect" on the language server process

## Troubleshooting

### "No keywords found"

Check that `data/openfoam-keywords.json` exists:
```bash
ls -lh data/openfoam-keywords.json
```

If missing, run keyword extraction again.

### "Extension not activating"

1. Check file matches supported patterns
2. Look for errors: Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools â†’ Console
3. Check Output panel: OpenFOAM Language Server

### "No completions appearing"

1. Verify language server is running (Output panel)
2. Try manual trigger: `Ctrl+Space`
3. Check keyword database loaded (should see count in Output)

## Next Steps

- **Customize**: Edit `src/extractor/extractKeywords.ts` to add more keywords
- **Extend**: Add new features in `src/language-server/server.ts`
- **Share**: Package and share with your team
- **Contribute**: Improve keyword coverage and documentation

## Support

For issues and questions:
- Check the main [README.md](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Review the [Known Limitations](README.md#known-limitations) section
- Check TODO comments in the source code

## Success Indicators

âœ… Extension activates for OpenFOAM files
âœ… Syntax highlighting displays correctly  
âœ… Hover shows keyword documentation
âœ… Completions suggest relevant keywords
âœ… Output shows "ready with 2990 keywords"
âœ… No errors in Developer Tools console
